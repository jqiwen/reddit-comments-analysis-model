1068,"Google offers ‘voluntary exit’ to all US platforms and devices employees | Those who leave will get severance, and the company wants anyone that stays to be ‘deeply committed’ to its mission","thanks for the extra details but thats exactly what a small company is. what does 'worth tens of million' even mean? one million is about..5 top developer salaries.

google laid off something like 13,000 people in the past 2 years. that doesnt count this 'voluntary exit' shit. meta laid off closer to 22,000 and its still not done.

but yah im sure all of these ex-employees are gonna be so glad that your small company is gonna be able to hire like 10 of them, since you're only after the cream of the crop."

1333,"Banks in Japan are blocking Steam payments for sex games, leaving Japanese adult game devs cut off from income | Stalled Steam profits are prompting free speech concerns.","I believe their argument is something like “excessive abundance of erotic media discourages young people from forming relationships with each other. Instead young folks use easily accessible pornography for quick gratification.” The current idea from certain political parties is that porn replaces sex and that by eliminating porn you push people to sex for gratification. I don’t think it’s a useful argument regardless of its questionable validity. The internet is saturated with so much adult content that any attempt to censor it is a wash. 

Now to play devil’s advocate, issues surrounding electronic payment for adult content have existed for a long time even if they weren’t mainstream. Hypno kink for instance generally has issues paying creators. Although that’s more down to the nature of dubious consent in certain scenarios which credit card companies want to avoid since it’s grounds to cancel a payment."

Chinese companies, new startups etc are building better products and at a fraction of the cost. There’s an inflection point now where if these companies don’t change they’ll go the way of all the former big tech companies, slowly into extinction.

388,ICE Is Swiftly Expanding Its Sprawling Surveillance Apparatus,"Oh, this is quite the mix of legal confusion and a bit of dystopian paranoia. Let’s unpack it step by step.

First, the idea that foreign nationals are “not bound by the US Constitution” is simply incorrect. The Constitution applies to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, not just citizens. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court in cases like Plyler v. Doe (1982) and Zadvydas v. Davis (2001). The 14th Amendment explicitly states that “any person” within the United States is entitled to equal protection and due process under the law.

If foreign nationals were not bound by US laws, then why do they get arrested, tried, and sentenced when they commit crimes? It is almost as if the legal system does apply to them. Wild, right?

Now, regarding mass surveillance, yes, government surveillance exists, but equating it to the Chinese Communist Party’s control over its citizens is quite the leap. In the US, we at least have legal challenges, oversight mechanisms, and constitutional protections like the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. That does not mean there are not concerns about privacy, but comparing it to the CCP’s complete authoritarian control over information is like saying your HOA enforcing lawn care rules is the same as a totalitarian police state.

Lastly, I absolutely agree that people should be more mindful of what they share about themselves online, but here is the kicker. The government is not expanding mass surveillance because of undocumented immigrants knowing their rights. It is often justified under national security concerns, technological advancements, and, let’s be real, people willingly putting their entire lives on social media for free.

So, if we are worried about government overreach, maybe we should focus on the actual policies enabling it rather than making undocumented immigrants the scapegoat. Just a thought."

2. We are popular now. We start extracting wealth from our business and people are lining up to use it. We cannot grow fast enough. Grow! Grow!

3. Things are saturated. We don't have anywhere to grow any longer. We can't think of anything new to do. We start looking for ways to cut costs, and obviously we aren't going to lower executive benefits and pay, so we start laying off people who built the stuff that made us rich. Also, no more fancy office space, and no more free coffee in the break room.

4. Oops, we fucked up! CEO is now fired, and company is on the block. No one of talent wants to work for us. Our pay is shit, the experience of working for us is like the government or worse, and our competitors are disrupting the fuck out of us.

It's not meant to be an investment. Currency shouldn't ever be an investment, and a currency with a rising value is pretty bad.

But we absolutely need something that isn't exclusively controlled by a few rich fucks. The government is one thing I guess, and generally less of a concern. But the big one I see a lot of is credit card companies being lobbied by religious groups.

It can be very much a symptom of the unintended consequences of eliminating incentives for people to stay at a given place of employment for the long term. Removal of pensions and other incentives alongside treating everyone as if they’re all replaceable has resulted in massive turnover as folks get pissed off or pushed out. At my company and many others I work with on a regular basis this has resulted in a real drain of institutional knowledge such that it can be difficult to maintain existing products or launch derivatives based on them simply because the people who really knew how they worked and why they were set up the way they are have gone. Even with very competent engineers it still results in finding all the problems over again as they unknowingly discover undocumented design decisions and constraints. It’s a serious issue directly linked to the behaviors of late stage capitalism and contributes too rising costs, late deliveries, and quality issues."

>Google has distributed a memo to all US employees working on Android, Pixel hardware, and other projects that offers a “voluntary exit program” guaranteeing severance for anyone willing to step away from their role at the company. The memo went out from platforms and devices SVP Rick Osterloh, according to 9to5Google.
>
>“This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year,” Osterloh wrote. “There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts can often be a precursor to layoffs if not enough employees take Google up on its offer and choose to leave.
>
>Google combined its Android and hardware teams under Osterloh in April. Executives said the streamlined approach would help it integrate AI features across products and services more quickly.
>
>...

>Some employees at Google have recently been circulating a petition that calls for CEO Sundar Pichai to offer exactly this type of optional buyout before resorting to involuntary layoffs. “Ongoing rounds of layoffs make us feel insecure about our jobs,” the petition said, according to CNBC. “The company is clearly in a strong financial position, making the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation hurt even more.”

It will be interesting to see what remains of these teams by the end of this attrition process, and whether they can still effectively deliver on the products and services that they were responsible for prior to the amalgamation and subsequent streamlining."

Every big tech company is trying to get as many of its US workers to quit as possible so they can replace them with what is essentially slave labor that won't complain or quit because their job is directly tied to their citizenship.

What's especially galling about this is that America already had all their employees essentially held hostage by their jobs by directly tying their access to healthcare to their employer.

I'd actually argue that the hive mind behaviour is real. Redditors will come in and the number of upvotes on a comment will 100% affect their feelings towards that comment. A comment that's slightly downvoted will often keep getting downvoted by zoned out redditors going on autopilot, even if that comment doesn't deserve it. The inverse is also true, upvoted comments get more upvotes, even if they're shit tier.

I often find that someone eventually replying to the comment with ""why is this downvoted"" will make the zoned out redditors take a step back and actually think why it's downvoted. Or maybe they'll just let the second comment decide their feelings instead of the first, who knows.

Broadly speaking, you can look at the birth of SV as an event that played out over about 30 years, give or take. Computer technology got rapidly cheaper and more prolific in the late 70's through 90's. Then the Internet was a pure greenfield from the 90's to the 2010. Smartphones were the next thing - internet connected computers, but in your hand. But those haven't substantially changed in 10 years or more! They're faster, more ram, faster Internet.. but none of that has enabled truly new apps, just the old ones.. but faster.

But there is only so much ""X-but-on-a-computer"" and ""Y-but-instead-of-on-a-standalone-computer-now-on-the-Internet,"" ""Z-on-a-handheld-computer-on-the-internet"" that can happen. The green field is no longer green it is full of high rises.

When was the last time a truly innovative company even emerged, let alone IPOed from SV? And before that one, how long before the previous one? 

So now you're saying - do something that has already been done, but better/different/cheaper/faster, etc. And defeat the incumbent? It has been long enough now we can look at the track record of THAT happening. For instance - social media. Facebook absolutely obliterated MySpace. It wasn't THAT different, but it was some different. But how long has it been since something truly challenged Facebook? And when something different does come along it gets crushed quickly - FB bought Instagram for $1Billion with 12 employees because they were rightly afraid. Good for those 12 employees.  But what has come along to compete with FB \*or\* Instagram, let alone FB \*and\* Instagram?"

664,Microsoft layoffs go ‘harder’: Termination ‘effective immediately’ with no severance pay and … - The Times of India,"I don’t think you’re using it wrong but it sounds like you are asking it to do much more complex things than I normally do. I’m usually asking it to write a function for my code not the whole code. Or I am asking it to write something simple because I need something I know can be done easily but it’s not something I would normally do. A simple example would be this past week I asked it to make a Powershell script to upload a file from an on-prem server to an Azure blob using an SAS key. Easy peasy I know but don’t normally need to do that and don’t know what functions to even try to use. A few seconds later I have a script I could tweak, test, and move on. Since I’m often working with multiple database platforms and a handful of different code languages I usually know something can be done I just need a nudge of the correct way to do it in the language or platform I’m working with. Then I can run with developing the rest of the solution or fixing whatever is broke."

Just take the morale hit or whatever and fire the # of low performers you need to get your cost structure right. Offering severance seems to incentivize talented workers who can go anywhere easily to go ahead and take it and bounce while incentivizing the unambitious to go hide in their caves.  

It pretends everyone is equal/their impact is equally distributed when that's never the case. The 'mission' people can be just as satisfied at Apple or Tesla or whatever other hardware company."

>“WhatsApp has disrupted a spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted a number of users including journalists and members of civil society. We’ve reached out directly to people who we believe were affected. This is the latest example of why spyware companies must be held accountable for their unlawful actions. WhatsApp will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately,” a company spokesperson said.

>The Guardian reached out to Paragon Solutions for a comment but the company did not immediately respond.
>
>WhatsApp said it believed the so-called vector, or means by which the infection was delivered to users, was through a malicious pdf file that was sent to individuals who were added to group chats. WhatsApp said it could say with “confidence” that Paragon was linked to this targeting.
