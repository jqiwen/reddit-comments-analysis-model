Yes, I don’t even believe myself tbh. But I can see this happening with the data I’ve been seeing and honestly it’s good to correlate what you see because patterns do exist.

Being terminated without cause which is what sounds like what happened to you means it's not at your fault. At this point the company can offer you a severance package or not. Typically a severance package comes with an agreement that you won't file for unemployment benefits. However, if you're terminated without cause and they don't offer a severance package. You are fully entitled to file for unemployment and they can't file to deny it.

They’re doing what employees asked for. Also, buyouts are common enough and better than mass involuntary layoffs.

290,Apartment landlords can force tenants to use specific ISPs under new FCC action | A previous proposal would have allowed residents to opt out of the landlord's ISP choice,"What you are saying is not  my experience and understanding.  Let's say you own a duplex with both units running on Verizon FIOS.  Verizon runs their own cables from the street into your units either overhead or underground.  They mist drill at leas 1 hole in the exterior and add exterior/interior hardware.  If one renter decides they want to run Comcast, then then entirely separate infrastructure must be installed for Comcast. Comcast must run a separate line to the structure overhead or underground.  Then they drill a separate hole for interior access and install separate interior and/or exterior hardware.  The same issue is sometimes the case for getting the cables from the exterior penetration to the router. 

This might be a smaller issue for large new buildings with networking rooms, but tons of America is not setup like this.  You see it all the time at small complexes and 2-4 unit structures.  A variety of poorly installed data lines with wires all over the place and a bunch of penetrations.

I'm not talking about built in distribution systems like cat/coax run in the walls of the structure for individual rooms.  That's entirely different and I think less important as most can connect through wifi these days.",High-Value
660,"Dell is making everyone return to office, too","Under US labor law (specifically, the US WARN Act), a company of a certain size, engaging in a substantial-enough layoff event is required to give a certain amount of notice to their employees (90 days).

A way companies have taken to get around this is to just pay out equivalent severances.

So yeah, you're right, there is no requirement for a company to pay severance.  The caveat to that is, if they don't pay severance, they cannot just walk you and your coworkers out of the building with a ""good luck"" and zero notice.",High-Value
