All results will be automatically saved under the `outputs/` folder.

### 📁 Outputs Directory Overview

There are **3 main result files** saved under the `outputs/` folder:

- `data_annotation_with_ground_truth.xlsx` — Final annotated dataset with adjudicated ground truth labels.
- `ground_truth_label_distribution_pie.png` — Pie chart showing the distribution of ground truth labels.
- `baseline_results.txt` — Evaluation results from both baseline and trained models.

### 📁 training_model Directory Overview

There are **3 Python files** under the `training_model/` directory:

- `data_analysis.py` contains Annotation Analysis, includes Cohen's Kappa (the result will be printed on terminal)，Ground Truth Adjudication, and Ground Truth Distripution Pie
