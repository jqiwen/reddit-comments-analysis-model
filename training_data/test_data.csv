1333,"Banks in Japan are blocking Steam payments for sex games, leaving Japanese adult game devs cut off from income | Stalled Steam profits are prompting free speech concerns.","I believe their argument is something like “excessive abundance of erotic media discourages young people from forming relationships with each other. Instead young folks use easily accessible pornography for quick gratification.” The current idea from certain political parties is that porn replaces sex and that by eliminating porn you push people to sex for gratification. I don’t think it’s a useful argument regardless of its questionable validity. The internet is saturated with so much adult content that any attempt to censor it is a wash. 

Now to play devil’s advocate, issues surrounding electronic payment for adult content have existed for a long time even if they weren’t mainstream. Hypno kink for instance generally has issues paying creators.

388,ICE Is Swiftly Expanding Its Sprawling Surveillance Apparatus,"Oh, this is quite the mix of legal confusion and a bit of dystopian paranoia. Let’s unpack it step by step.

First, the idea that foreign nationals are “not bound by the US Constitution” is simply incorrect. The Constitution applies to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, not just citizens. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court in cases like Plyler v. Doe (1982) and Zadvydas v. Davis (2001). The 14th Amendment explicitly states that “any person” within the United States is entitled to equal protection and due process under the law.

If foreign nationals were not bound by US laws, then why do they get arrested, tried, and sentenced when they commit crimes? It is almost as if the legal system does apply to them. Wild, right?

Now, regarding mass surveillance, yes, government surveillance exists, but equating it to the Chinese Communist Party’s control over its citizens is quite the leap. In the US, we at least have legal challenges, oversight mechanisms, and constitutional protections like the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. That does not mean there are not concerns about privacy, but comparing it to the CCP’s complete authoritarian control over information is like saying your HOA enforcing lawn care rules is the same as a totalitarian police state.

Lastly, I absolutely agree that people should be more mindful of what they share about themselves online, but here is the kicker. The government is not expanding mass surveillance because of undocumented immigrants knowing their rights. It is often justified under national security concerns, technological advancements, and, let’s be real, people willingly putting their entire lives on social media for free.

So, if we are worried about government overreach, maybe we should focus on the actual policies enabling it rather than making undocumented immigrants the scapegoat. Just a thought.",High-Value

It can be very much a symptom of the unintended consequences of eliminating incentives for people to stay at a given place of employment for the long term. Removal of pensions and other incentives alongside treating everyone as if they’re all replaceable has resulted in massive turnover as folks get pissed off or pushed out. At my company and many others I work with on a regular basis this has resulted in a real drain of institutional knowledge such that it can be difficult to maintain existing products or launch derivatives based on them simply because the people who really knew how they worked and why they were set up the way they are have gone. Even with very competent engineers it still results in finding all the problems over again as they unknowingly discover undocumented design decisions and constraints.

>“This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year,” Osterloh wrote. “There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts can often be a precursor to layoffs if not enough employees take Google up on its offer and choose to leave.

>Google combined its Android and hardware teams under Osterloh in April. Executives said the streamlined approach would help it integrate AI features across products and services more quickly.

>Some employees at Google have recently been circulating a petition that calls for CEO Sundar Pichai to offer exactly this type of optional buyout before resorting to involuntary layoffs. “Ongoing rounds of layoffs make us feel insecure about our jobs,” the petition said, according to CNBC. “The company is clearly in a strong financial position, making the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation hurt even more.”

Broadly speaking, you can look at the birth of SV as an event that played out over about 30 years, give or take. Computer technology got rapidly cheaper and more prolific in the late 70's through 90's. Then the Internet was a pure greenfield from the 90's to the 2010. Smartphones were the next thing - internet connected computers, but in your hand. But those haven't substantially changed in 10 years or more! They're faster, more ram, faster Internet.. but none of that has enabled truly new apps, just the old ones.. but faster.

But there is only so much ""X-but-on-a-computer"" and ""Y-but-instead-of-on-a-standalone-computer-now-on-the-Internet,"" ""Z-on-a-handheld-computer-on-the-internet"" that can happen. The green field is no longer green it is full of high rises.

When was the last time a truly innovative company even emerged, let alone IPOed from SV? And before that one, how long before the previous one? 

So now you're saying - do something that has already been done, but better/different/cheaper/faster, etc. And defeat the incumbent? It has been long enough now we can look at the track record of THAT happening. For instance - social media. Facebook absolutely obliterated MySpace. It wasn't THAT different, but it was some different. But how long has it been since something truly challenged Facebook? And when something different does come along it gets crushed quickly - FB bought Instagram for $1Billion with 12 employees because they were rightly afraid. Good for those 12 employees.  But what has come along to compete with FB \*or\* Instagram, let alone FB \*and\* Instagram?",High-Value

I’m usually asking it to write a function for my code not the whole code. Or I am asking it to write something simple because I need something I know can be done easily but it’s not something I would normally do. A simple example would be this past week I asked it to make a Powershell script to upload a file from an on-prem server to an Azure blob using an SAS key. Easy peasy I know but don’t normally need to do that and don’t know what functions to even try to use. A few seconds later I have a script I could tweak, test, and move on. Since I’m often working with multiple database platforms and a handful of different code languages I usually know something can be done I just need a nudge of the correct way to do it in the language or platform I’m working with.
