1338,Microsoft layoffs go ‘harder’: Termination ‘effective immediately’ with no severance pay and … - The Times of India,"I think you got it wrong.  This was a-   I was one of them back in the day after the lawsuit.  

Aka a dash trash - and admittedly this was often the case because the hiring process was very weak,  and often it was just warm bodies for manually testing releases or doing other lower skill coding jobs. 

V- employees were always long term contracts. 

V- employees aka vendors have different rules such as renting their office space and paying for their own laptops etc.   The idea being that by paying for their own stuff they were treated as truly outside vendors on contract. 

These vendor contracts could definitely be short term but they weren’t the 18/6 rule. 

A- employees who had the 18th month rule could use Microsoft services.

Also Microsoft no longer hires a- employees to my knowledge since satya took over.

Edit - this might not be the case for bought out companies like blizzard,  Skype ( is that still a thing lol ) etc.",High-Value

133,"Google offers ‘voluntary exit’ to all US platforms and devices employees | Those who leave will get severance, and the company wants anyone that stays to be ‘deeply committed’ to its mission","It's harder than you think. Different business, but I know in poultry that the big 3 suppliers (like Tyson) have a huge stranglehold on the market. So much so that when new companies start trying to expand that they can't even get loans. Even when they have a higher profit than cost and are making money. Then they start getting more orders than they can fill, and can't expand facilities, and rising costs associated with this eventually run the business into the ground. And this was something a close family member said, they could have had a chance to be bigger in the free range poultry but the big 3 pressure banks not to loan and you have to have money before you can take off. So it stalls and fails. Look at allegations of price collusion in poultry and you'll see that it's a very shady industry. Probably is the same in tech, and investors get pressure from big tech not to invest, big tech pushes the products away from people, and they end up going bankrupt or getting bought out by the companies trying to suppress them.",High-Value

“After the ruling, Rokudenashiko noted in a press conference that she was only acquitted on the second charge because the judge decided that her vagina molds “didn’t look like real female genitals,” meaning that, according to the ruling, genitalia are still considered “obscene objects” in Japan.

Japan’s obscenity law is both severe and nebulous, harshly restricting the distribution, display, and sale of “obscene materials” but failing to define what, exactly, constitutes obscenity.”

For me her sculptures are in part performance art, she knows this works will be targeted by the law and does so to provoke social discussions (beyond the sculpture) around legality of artworks based on morality, what is considered obscene and who gets to judge it.

The sculpture needs this context to be completely viewed.

Funnily enough, people on Reddit would post images of it without the context so others would say this isn’t arty enough.

4. The foreigners are probably the biggest fool in all of this. the money they send to the US will never come back. OpenAI will always be in US control, regardless of success or failure, as will any nuclear power plants or million GPU's that are installed there and the jobs created there. Foreigners have the least to gain and the most to lose in this project.

what really confounds me is when you weigh the risks n rewards, DS is a far better investment for the foreigners. even if DS becomes commercial failure, there will be substantial benefit in having a powerful open source AI which their domestic business can use and benefit at little cost. where as OpenAI's success will allow the USA gov't to ransom these foreign countries - who knows what Trump will demand after Greenland and Panama?",High-Value

* I’ve seen staffing agencies caught placing the same off shore people to many companies.

* I've seen managers so self-interested in getting promoted they shortlist hires for ""sr"" roles only to find out they have zero experience and their first job is to lead a 5+ million dollar application.   

* Lots of sleeping with/cheating with direct reports

902,"Dell is making everyone return to office, too","The letter is so full of contradictions and goes against all research into this topic. Why can he not just say what this is all about? Valuation of corporate real estate and impacts on stock price.

The letter assumes physical presence drives productivity, but research consistently shows remote and hybrid models are at least as effective, if not better for knowledge workers. It claims office work leads to faster decision-making, but digital collaboration tools reduce bottlenecks just as effectively. It frames passion and energy as office-dependent, but research shows that engagement is driven by job autonomy, not location. It promises flexibility while eliminating hybrid work, which contradicts flexibility research.

**Claim: ""Nothing is faster than the speed of human interaction.""**

***Contradiction with Research***: Studies have shown that while ad hoc conversations can be efficient, constant in-office interruptions (chats, meetings, and background noise) can actually reduce deep work productivity. A study from Harvard Business School found that open offices reduced face-to-face collaboration by 70% as employees compensated by relying more on digital communication. Remote work tools (Slack, Teams, Asana, etc.) facilitate rapid decision-making without the inefficiencies of physical workplace distractions.

**Claim: ""For us to lead, the speed of our business must continue to accelerate.""**

***Contradiction with Research***: Productivity metrics from the Stanford Work From Home Experiment (2021) showed that remote workers were 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that remote employees worked longer hours but experienced less burnout due to better work-life balance. Microsoft’s New Future of Work Report found that employees were more efficient remotely, particularly in roles requiring focus and problem-solving.

**Claim: ""We've already asked our sales teams, manufacturing teams, engineers in the labs, onsite team members and leaders to be in the office five days a week, and we have seen these areas come alive with new speed, energy, and passion.""**

***Contradiction with Research***: While some roles benefit from physical presence (manufacturing, lab work), knowledge workers do not require full-time office presence to be engaged or passionate. A 2022 McKinsey & Company report found that employees with the flexibility to work remotely were more engaged, happier, and less likely to leave compared to those forced back into offices. Gallup’s workplace research shows that autonomy and flexibility—not physical location—drive engagement and motivation.

**Claim: ""We remain committed to flexibility within your workday.""**

***Contradiction with Research***: - Flexibility is not just about work hours—it includes location flexibility. Gartner’s 2023 Hybrid Work Report found that companies that eliminated hybrid work in favor of RTO had higher turnover rates and decreased employee satisfaction. Deloitte’s 2022 Workplace Study showed that forcing employees into offices without compelling reasons led to higher attrition rates.

**Claim: ""We continually evolve our business to deliver the best value and service to our customers and partners.""**

***Contradiction with Research***: Remote and hybrid work models have not shown a decline in service quality or business value—in fact, companies that embraced hybrid work models reported increased output. The PwC 2023 Future of Work Survey found that remote workers were just as productive as in-office employees and that hybrid work led to higher employee satisfaction without harming customer outcomes. IBM’s Work-from-Anywhere Study found that companies that embraced remote work outperformed competitors in revenue growth and talent retention.",High-Value

705,Microsoft layoffs go ‘harder’: Termination ‘effective immediately’ with no severance pay and … - The Times of India,"In the past, when I worked there, each year as an employee you were expected to set out some targets for you to achieve over the next year. They were expected to show personal growth as well as align in some fashion to the managers above you. You and your manager should have periodic touch bases to make sure people are making progress and updating those targets as needed. 

At the end of the review cycle, managers generated a ranking of their employees and gathered with other managers at the same level to 'stack rank' the team. In general everyone's contributions were looked at and a bell curve would emerge that showed low/med/high performers and rewards were considered from there. 

In the early 1990s people got bonuses as sort of a rite of passage. By the end of the 2000's people got bonuses for showing something really noteworthy in their contribution. If you were a high performer for multiple cycles then you were considered for promotion and if you were deemed a low performer you would have a different conversation with your manager. 

I'm not sure how it works now, but early 1990s those conversations would be be kinder and encouraging people to improve and perhaps at a higher level look to see why someone might have clocked in at low performer status. For example, if someone came in the group with a stellar history and all of a sudden had a crap year - was it obvious why? Life event like tough divorce, or something could be considered. There was even consideration for the idea that maybe it was just a bad fit manager and employee. 

At times those things all made a difference. Employees were generally thought to have a chance to be redeemed and given a chance to prove it. Some would stay in their current group, and others might move teams or even to other parts of the company. Theory was the investment in interviewing, training, honing skills was too valuable to the company to just let someone go. Going with that, the paperwork required by legal and hr to make sure someone was given a chance often took a year to generate and document where given the chance to improve, but didn't. 

Into the 2000s the vibe shifted and while people were considered to be redeemable, they were given less chance to change groups and more camped on their current team to 'get better'. I left in the mid 2010's and when I was leaving there were more managers who were trying to do trial by fire with people; not really give people the chance to improve and more hoping if they made life shitty enough someone would quit and make their life easier. 

The core gatekeeper to triggering a 'Performance Improvement Plan' (PIP) was (is?) too many times in the low performer band. I suspect the number of time sin that band these days might be twice. Once 'in case' it was fluke and after that ... PIP. 

PIPs were (are) all over the place. Early on they could have been a reduced scope in those goals so someone could focus on improving. Sometimes they were a completely different focus to see if that helps, sometimes it could have been someone stunk as a lead so they were moved back to individual contributor and sent to 'how to be a manager' classes. Over time, the vibe was less generous towards employees being able to continue to contribute and shifted more towards a harder line of ""Shape Up or Ship Out"".",High-Value

889,Meta memo threatening to fire leakers is immediately leaked; Zuck says it sucks - 9to5Mac,"This method (""Canary trap"") is actually well known and has been used dozens of other times by three letter agencies, governments and private companies to do this exact thing. But as others are noting, it's really hard to do in large groups not just because of the permutations required but also because it's really easy to detect. All it takes is for the leaker to have a single sympathetic friend to share a copy of theirs. If there are language differences, you know a trap has been set. Smart leakers with good opsec will make slight modifications of their own (a simple as a thesaurus and a few grammar changes all the way to a rewrite with ChatGPT) which can throw off the detection without changing the content meaningfully enough to not trust it is true.

345,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to meet with Trump at White House,"What an insane take.  Billionaires don't care about the tariffs?  Let's say you're Jensen.  It costs you $100 for each graphics card you produce and you charge $2000.  That's $1900 profit to you and you did your math and decided it's exactly the price most people are willing to pay.  


Maybe 20 million are willing to pay $2000, but 21 million would buy it if it were $1800.  So you'd make $38 billion at a price of $2000 ($1900 profit) and $35.8 billion at the price of $1800 ($1700 profit) because even though less people are buying the card at $2000, you're making more profit because of the higher price.  


Now let's say all of a sudden a tariff is added and now it's $2500 from the 25% figure.  Do you still think the same people are willing to pay $500 extra for the same product.  Maybe only 15 million people would buy at that price and you have to remember you don't get any value from that $500 because it's not a part of your profit, so the price is $2500, but your profit is still $1900 per card and since only 15 million people buy you make  (1900x15 million) $28.5 billion.  That's $10 billion less money you're making instantaneously.
